# Robo-Friends

An exercise from a full-stack web development course provided by Udemy designed to introduce React and the concept of props and state to the students. This exercise required me to build a web app where users can search for Robo-Friend(s) by typing in a name or an email address. To make it my own small personal project, I also implemented an option for users to change the background color gradient. 

# Instructions:

To test it on your own computer simply follow these steps:

1. Clone the project using git
2. Using Terminal, enter the directory of the cloned folder
3. Typed in "npm start" to run the script and open the project

# Demo:

Here is a short clip on what the project looks like:

# Tech/Framework used:

Built with:

- React
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript

Made an asynchronous call to **https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users** to fetch information for each robot such as a name, email address, and an id.

# Credits:

Thanks to Udemy for giving me this excercise to practice and develop my skills in web development as well as other knowledge in using React and making asynchronous calls.
